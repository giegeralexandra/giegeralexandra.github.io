As I inched closer and closer to the end of the Object Oriented Ruby coursework, I knew it would not be long before I was required to create a CLI application on my own. I was not dreading it, but I was not over the top excited. Not having the ability to easily type in "learn" and have a rspec already written up made me feel like I would never design a successful application. 

Turns out, I did not feel this way at all once I started the project. Day one I started writing my code in VS Code and could not stop. Before I knew it, I had written my Scraper class along with all my required classes. My code was working and it was only my first day working on it. I created a Scraper class, an Activity class, a ActivityTime class and a CLI class. My application scraped The Dallas World Aquarium Feeding and Talks page for activity information. 

From there, I decided I wanted to provide the user with an option to choose from a list of times or a list of activity names. Once they made their decision, they would be prompted with another list. I also gave the user an option to view all details of all times and activities. When the user made selections from these lists, I made sure to loop them back to the main menu. 

As I dug deeper into the project, I realized I did not do a few things. I did not create a gem and I did not start a repo on GitHub. I was so excited once I started coding that I finished all my files in VS Code. It took me 2-3 nights and hours of watching the available YouTube videos provided by Learn to figure out how to move my current code into a new gem and also a new repo. I feel silly now thinking about how confused I was. 

I spent a few more nights refactoring my code to ensure it was not repetitive. After deciding I had completed the project, I realized my menu options were repetitive (multiple of the same option) and had to completely refactor 5-6 of my methods. 

I think on the next project I will take things a little slower and make sure I am doing everything correctly from the start. Overall, I am proud of my accomplishments and had so much fun during the experience. Looking forward to what is next!
