As my time at Flatiron is coming to an end, I thought it would be a good idea to share a few pieces of advice to anybody freshly entering into this journey. It has been extremely fun but also challenging learning a completely new language and am so proud of myself for finishing the program. 

Here are my top four pieces of advice to anybody starting at Flatiron:

1.	Learn MacBook or Windows keyboard shortcuts at the very beginning. I did not learn them until half way through and it would have saved me a lot of time. 
2.	If you have free time, get ahead. At the start of school, I was trying to gradually get through the program. I did not want to knock an entire week’s worth of work in one weekend. I thought it would be better to do 2-4 lessons per day after work. Even though that probably is the best approach, you never know if you are going to get sick or something in your personal life happens that puts you weeks behind. It is better to be prepared. Get ahead as much as possible. 
3.	Do not be afraid to use Google. The first two module, I was also discouraged because I felt like I needed to know everything. As time went on, I realized Google was my friend – a great friend, actually! A part of being a software engineer is to be able to Google and do it efficiently.
4.	Do not be afraid to ask for help. It was not until the third module I started asking my fellow classmates for help. It is really helpful to talk with someone about your code and usually you end up finding out your own bug just by talking it out. 

I hope this advice helps you in your journey. It is a really exciting time and I know you are going to crush it!
