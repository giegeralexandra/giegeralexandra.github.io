From 2015 to 2019, I worked for an electronic components distributor, Future Electronics. I was an Account Manager and worked with hardware engineers on a daily basis. I was constantly striving to learn more about the hardware components so that I could be knowledgeable about my products. In 2019, I decided I wanted to move to New York City and saw this as an opportunity to change my career path. Because the software industry was developing at a more abundant rate than hardware, I knew it would a be greater avenue for growth.  

I began looking into software sales position in NYC. I ran across a few job opportunities with Amazon Web Services and started gaining interest in the cloud market. Unfortunately, a lot of the positions required experience with SaaS or a cloud platform. In order to grasp recruiters attention, I realized I had to go above and beyond. Amazon Web Services has a certification program. In a matter of a month, I studied for the AWS Solutions Architect Associate and AWS Cloud Practitioner, took the exam and received my certifications. How quickly the tables turned! Recruiters were coming to me and I was finally able to set interviews with cloud companies. 

In late 2019, I started a new sales position in the cloud market. I enjoyed my new job but did not feel I was exercising my brain to its full potential. I said to myself “If I can learn cloud technology this quickly, why can I not pursue a technical career?” I immediately began taking online software engineering classes, checking out different bootcamps and really enjoyed learning to code. I decided it was time to start making the technology instead of selling it. I applied to Flatiron and the rest if history!
